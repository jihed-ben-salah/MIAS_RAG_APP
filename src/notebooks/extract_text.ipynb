Increased RI may imply the presence of any type of underlying renal damage, includingischemic nephropathy.', 'Diabetes Care 31:1853–1857, 2008', 'Duplex Doppler ultrasonography', 'was used to assess intrarenal hemo-dynamics. The resistive index (RI)', 'calculated from blood ﬂow velocities invessels reﬂects renovascular resistanceand is known to increase in various disor-ders (1–5). Moreover, vasoactive agents,such as angiotensin II or ACE inhibitors(6), are known to affect RI. Regardingmechanisms by which RI of intrarenal ar-terioles increase, we previously reportedthat arterio-arteriolosclerosis rather thaninterstitial ﬁbrosis could play an impor-', 'tant role (7). In addition, we reported thatthere was a direct relationship between RIand arteriolosclerosis in damaged kid-neys, and RI at renal biopsy may be usefulas one of the prognostic markers for renaloutcome (7).', 'According to the annual report of the', 'Japan Dialysis Treatment Society in 2006,the most frequent cause of end-stage renaldisease is diabetes (8). Although diabeticnephropathy has been considered to be amicrovascular complication, histopatho-', 'logical examination of renal biopsiesshowed not only typical diffuse or nodu-lar lesions, but also arteriosclerotic glo-merulosclerosis (9). It has been reportedthat RI in patients with renal dysfunction(chronic renal failure) secondary to type 2diabetes were signiﬁcantly increasedcompared to the patients with nondia-betic chronic renal failure (10). Further-more, regardless of the status ofmicroalbuminuria, which has been con-sidered to be a risk factor for diabetic ne-phropathy and progression of renalinsufﬁciency, glomerular ﬁltration rate(GFR) was also reported to be correlatedwith RI (11). Indeed, there are several re-ports showing a correlation between RIand renal function (7,11,12). It is there-fore conceivable that nonalbuminuric re-nal insufﬁciency (13) could be related toother pathogenetic disorders, such asischemic nephropathy, rather than classicdiabetic nephropathy. In this regard, itshould be borne in mind that macroangi-opathy, not microangiopathy, is likely toaffect GFR because systemic atheroscle-rotic vascular disease adversely affects re-nal blood perfusion, resulting in a', 'decrease of GFR, even if clinically overtrenal artery stenosis is not evident. Ish-imura et al. (12) have already reportedthat RI values are signiﬁcantly correlatedwith both femoral and carotid arterial in-tima-media thickness (IMT) in type 2 di-abetic patients with nephropathy and thatintrarenal hemodynamics are affected bydecreased GFR, probably through ad-vanced arteriosclerosis. Recently, Ohta etal. (14) reported that increased RI of themain renal arteries is signiﬁcantly corre-lated with the severity of systemic athero-sclerosis. Furthermore, the intrarenalvascular resistance differs depending onthe underlying renal disease and appearsto increase to a greater extent in diabeticnephropathy (14).

Re-cent results regarding the pathophysiol-ogy of renal disease in type 2 diabeteshave challenged the concept that a declinein renal function in patients with diabetesis always accompanied by increased albu-minuria. MacIsaac et al.
